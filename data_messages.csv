Every year, the month of June is the month where many countries around the world come together for PRIDE to celebrate diversity, freedom to love, and discrimination against the LGBTQ+ community. This year, amid the cloud of the COVID pandemic, let us not forget that discrimination still exist in different parts of the world, in different pockets of society and even in homes.

So in the spirit of PRIDE, let us stand together to fight discrimination (of any form) in our society. Be proud and not be afraid to speak up for yourself, or when you see acts of discriminations happening around you - in public, in your work place, your school or at home.

Now, let the rainbow shine!"

Happy Pinkdot! Love lives here. Equality for all! 🌈
"We often live in a world of judgements and we struggled to fit in a ""space"" for survival. We may not be ""Normal"" to the ""Society deemed Normal"" people, but fear not as we do not owed these people any explanation on how we choose to live our lives.

There will definitely be groups of people who are against or for LGBTQ rights. It will not be easy for us, LGBTQ Singaporeans, to have certain rights BUT as long as we are united and keep our hopes and faith, one day we will eventually achieve what we yearn for, as LOVE has no boundaries! 

To my dear struggling/closet LGBTQ peers, you are bigger and better than who you think you are! Do not live in fear as fear will only consume you. Dare to love who you want to love, be who you want to be and most importantly believe in yourself!

we shall continue to fight for equality for all in singapore!! here’s to getting closer to ending the stigma around lgbt!!
the society needs to do better to listen and show love
We've really outdone ourselves in living amongst those who are anti-LGBT. We've survived and pushed ourselves through moments where we doubt ourselves. Let's keep pushing and let's keep putting ourselves out there. Let's be louder! Prouder! Let's validate ourselves because that matters way more than anything else!!
Love always wins ❤️
"Even in these dark days, life is full of hope and love. We will never give up the fight."

"🏳️‍🌈 PRIDE IS NOT FOR QUEER PEOPLE

PRIDE IS NOT about “being gay and free” for QUEER PEOPLE and/or being queer friendly. it’s about BEING FREE FROM OUR OWN RESTRICTIVE MINDS, so we can live a life BEING OURSELVES. It IS FOR EVERYONE. 

My wish is for queer organizations to have no need for existence one day. Till then, we are building something together, stay tune and happy pride, whoever you aspire to be!"

Love should not have a pricetag. Love is for everyone. Love should be easy. You deserve to be love and you deserve to love.
"The best thing about coming out is, it's totally liberating. You feel like you've made this incredible discovery about yourself and you want to share it and be open and honest and not spend all your time wondering how is this person going to react, or should I be careful around this person, or what will the neighbors say? And it's more. It's about getting past the question of what's wrong with me, to knowing there's nothing wrong, that you were born this way. You're a normal person and a beautiful person and you should be proud of who you are. You deserve to live with dignity and show people your pride."

"I wish everyone can be comfortable in their own skin, that they know they will be accepted for who they are. Regardless."
"Everyone deserves love, no matter how they identify"
"“Let us realize the arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice.” - MLK Junior"
Love does not express in a binary way!!!
